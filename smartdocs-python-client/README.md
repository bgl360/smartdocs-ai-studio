### Quick Start

main.py is a temple showing how to retrieve the extraction/classification by uploading a single pdf file.
Prior to execution, please make sure you update the main.py with api key and project id.

```sh
python main.py --file <path to pdf file>
```

if no file path is provided, the default file path is "resources/samples/extraction/insurance-receipt-sample.pdf" and
you need to have a project with project type "Insurance Receipt" created in your account to test out the extraction.
